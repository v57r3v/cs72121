PART   B
Question 7   (20   marks)
Read the article titled   " Cyclone   Debbie   leaves a   sour taste for   sugar   cane growers"   and   answer the following   questions
Cyclone   Debbie   leaves a sour taste for sugar cane   growers.
Cyclone   Debbie crossed the coast   near the Whitsunday   islands   in   March   28,   2017   and tore   a path from   Bowen   in QLD down to   Northern   New South   Wales   bringing   260   kph winds,   torrential rains and flooding. The storm caused a   total   of   $3.5   billion   in   damage.   The   cost   to   Queensland’s   sugar   industry,   in   destroyed   cane   infrastructure and equipment was $250   million.   Cane growers   Queensland   chairman   Paul Schembri said   125,000ha of cane   farms from   Bowen   to   south   of   Mackay were severely damaged. Sugar   production volume   loss   on   average   was   20 to   25%   from   the three   regions of   Burdekin,   Proserpine and   Mackay that   produce 50%   of Australia’s   national   sugar cane crop. The   losses would also far   exceed that   for   many   individual   cane   farms   in   the   most severely affected   locations.The cyclone   disrupted   production   methods.   Most sugar cane   is   mechanically   harvested whilst   still green   and the canes are standing   upright.   However,   the   cyclone   winds   caused   damage to   farm structures and   bent and flattened the canes. Torrential   rains   then   flooded   the   fields   and   farm tracks with   debris.Sprawled   crops   make   mechanical   harvesting difficult. After the damaged cane   dries   out   and fine   weather   returns, the green   leaves at the top turn toward the   sun to   try   to   stand   up   again   but         the cane stick   itself often   remains flattened   and   bent on   the   ground.   There   is   a   risk   of   damage   to   mechanical   harvesters from cane   in that condition   and excessive   leaf   and   other   unseen   debris   in the fields. The smaller crop yields   less tonnes to   spread   costs   over   and   even   where         mechanical   harvesters can still   be   used, the excessive   leaf and   other   debris   in   the   fields   slows   harvesting time down,   increasing costs further.   Many cane growers   resorted   to   burning the flattened   cane   in the fields of excess   leaf and   debris, to   salvage   some   harvest,   a   method   not used for decades. This   is a   more   labour   intensive   method of   harvesting.
Cyclone   Debbie’s timing was   not good for sugar cane   growers. The   cane   was   nowhere   near   its   traditional   harvest time   (December) so couldn’t   be   harvested early.   The   best   some farmers hoped for was that the cane ‘would straighten   itself   up’   .   In   addition,   the   global   sugar   price   had   been above   US $22 cents   in   2016   but   had fallen to   between   U.S.   $12   cents   and   U.S.   $13   cents         per   pound   by August   2017, after trader   realisations that   a global surplus was   emerging.   One   bank analyst   linked sugar   prices to the oil   price, which   had   been   under   downward   pressure   for   two years. This then   put   pressure on the ethanol   price   in   Brazil, forcing   Brazilian   sugar  代 写SAMPLE FINAL EXAM – ECONOMICS FOR BUSINESS 2C/C++
代做程序编程语言 mills to      reduce ethanol   production   and   increase sugar   production. Good weather also   prevailed   in   South   East Asian   cane growing   nations contributing to the emerging   global   surplus. The   price   fall was further exaggerated   by speculators who were   selling   on the   market.   Some   cane   growers   may   not   have suffered the   price fall as   badly as   others   if   they   had   secured   earlier   more   favourable forward   pricing contracts over their crop.Australian cane growers claimed that the   price was   approaching “cost   of   production”   even   without the cleanup and damage costs   caused   by   Cyclone   Debbie.   Growers   were   forced   to   search   hard for cost   cuts such   as   reducing the   nutrient or   irrigation or   maintenance   inputs      despite   knowing such cuts would   impair   next year’s   product quality.
The   Indian   Government then declared subsidies for   its sugar   industry   in September   2017,   indicating further   increases   in global   production, causing the global   price   to fall   below the   cost   of   production. The Australian sugar   industry   receives   no government   price support   and 80%   of   Australian sugar   is exported, so the   industry   is trade exposed   to   global   sugar   market   price   volatility.
Cane growers   Proserpine   manager   Mike   Porter said growers just   had to follow the appropriate   steps;
“There   is   nothing else you   can do. This   is an export   industry,   so   we   are   captured   by   both   the   international commodity   price and the exchange   rate. We   don’t   have   control   over   either fundamentals.”
One   Queensland   cane grower estimated   his   loss at   $400,00 -   $500,000   in   2017 on   the   back   of   the cyclone, global sugar glut and   subsequent very   dry   conditions   through   2017   and   2018,   claiming   recovery would take   him five years.   However, for   many farms total   recovery   may   never   be   possible,   leaving them vulnerable to future climate events.
7.1    What   market structure   most   appropriately describes the sugar   cane   growing   industry?
7.2    Explain what the   likely short   run   effect   of the   cyclone   is   on   the   cost   curves   of   a   sugar   cane   growing firm   in the cyclone affected   region?
7.3    Explain   using the   relevant   market   structure   model, the   likely   short   run   effect   of the   cyclone   on   the   profits   and   quantities   produced    by   sugar   cane   growing   farms   in   the   cyclone   affected   region
7.4    What is the long term response in the industry to the existence of economic losses, economic   profits   or    normal    profit?    How   will   the    changes   from   Q.5.2   and    Q.5.3   affect   the   firm’s    profit position   in   both the short   run   and   long   run?
Question 8   (20   marks)
Read the article titled   " Wages, consumption and   GDP growth   remain   sluggish   despite   an   increase   in employment   " and answer the following   questions.
Wages, consumption and GDP growth   remain sluggish   despite an   increase   in   employment.
In the ten years   prior to the global financial crisis Australia’s   real   GDP   grew   3.4%   on   average   per   year, decelerating to   1.6%   in   2009 after the turmoil. Australia showed   resilience   being   one   of   the few developed   nations that still   recorded growth   in   2009. Since then   Australia’s   real   GDP   growth   has averaged   below 3%   but grew   just   2.3% for the year   ended   December   2018   (seasonally adjusted).   Inflation continues to   be   low, yet   all   key   measures of   inflation   are   now   currently   below the   Reserve   Bank’s   preferred   2 to 3%   band. The economic   indicators that   signal   the start   of a downturn   are emerging   in   many   advanced   economies   including Australia.
Australian   households are   carrying a   high total   private   sector   debt   ratio   of   121   percent   of GDP   in June   2018,   making   us   less   resilient to future shocks.
Australia   is also seeing the   lowest growth   in wages   as   a   percentage   of   economic   activity   since   1959 when official   records commenced. This   is despite   mostly growth   year   on   year   in   labour productivity over the same   period. The clear downward   trend   in   wages   share   of   GDP   is visible   from   1980 to current, despite short term small   fluctuations,   with   labour   compensation   as   a percentage of GDP falling from 56%   in   1980 to   46.5%   in   2018.   Nominal   wage   growth   has   now   been around   2% a year   since   2015.
Record   numbers of Australians are also working   a   second job. The   number   exceeded   one million   persons at the end   of   2018   having   increased   by   more than   20%   in the   past   two years.
Since   2010 the wage   price   index shows the   real   value of   wages   growth   has fallen   from   7% to
2.3% whilst secondary jobs   have   risen from 3.8% to   6.3% of total jobs   over   the   same   period.
Secondary job   roles feature work   like caring, office temping, call   centre   answering,   uber   driving   and other delivery services, and   healthcare   and   social   assistance work.
Despite a small   rise   in the employment   statistics   in the   years   since   the   GFC,   underemployment   levels   have   risen from just   2.5%   in   1980 to 9% of the   labour force   in   2018.   Underemployment   needs to   be considered   in context with   headline employment figures.   Younger   Australians   are more affected   by   underemployment   and disproportionately so. 31%   of   workers   aged   15-19   and   20% of workers aged   20 –   24 are   underemployed.   Underemployment   in other   age   demographics does   not exceed 9%. According to the   OECD, Australia   has   the   highest   proportion   of “temporary”   (including casual) jobs   in the   OECD. With   higher   underemployment   levels the headline employment   rate   is therefore   likely to   include a significant   number   of   people who   want   more work and   cannot get   it as well   as those   who   may   be   working   two jobs to   make   ends   meet,   indicating that the   labour force   is   underutilised.
In   an open   letter signed   by   124   Labour   Market,   Employment   Relations and   Labour   Law
Researchers,   Dr Stanford Jim Stanford, economist, claimed Australia   was   in   the   grip   of   a   “wages   crisis” that “isn’t going to fix   itself”   citing an “unprecedented   slowdown”   despite   the employment growth. The economists called for various   measures as   a   matter   of   urgency   to tackle the crisis,   including   raising the   minimum wage, strengthening collective   wage   bargaining,   relaxing caps on the   public sector and   limiting   the   ability   of   private   firms   to   outsource.   Professor John Quiggin, one signatory to the   letter   commented;
“for decades, government   policy   has   been designed to weaken   unions   and   push wages   down.   It’s time to   put that   process   into   reverse.”
Australia’s current Treasurer declined to   respond to the written   concerns of   labour   market   experts. The   Prime   Minister countered that   increasing wages costs on   businesses   would contribute to   loss of jobs. The argument   is that tax cuts for   business   owners   will   drive investment and   create   more jobs. The   Business Council of Australia supports   the   idea   of   business tax cuts and similarly argues   against   ‘tinkering   with   wages’   lest   it   cause ‘higher   prices   and   lost jobs’   .
Some   businesses claim they are   now suffering   because of   sluggish   consumption.   The   $310 billion   retail sector   remains   largely   in   recession due to   both   low wage growth   and   high   debt   carried   by   households.   Retail sales growth slowed to   2.2%   in the   2018 year.   One   market   adviser   warns that   big   box   retail   is “slowly dying” with even   heavyweights   like   Bunnings and   DanMurphy’s   now facing “significant store closures.”    The   physical   retail sector   has   already taken   a   hit from the growth of online shopping.   Many jobs   in   stores   like   Kmart, Woolworths,   Coles   and   others   have   been   lost to automation such   as electronic scan   and   pay   systems.   Other   local jobs   have   been   lost to the complete automation   of factories and   outsourcing   of   call   centre   operations.
Slow wages growth forces   households to   reduce their discretionary spending   or   look for   lower priced goods and services. Wages   are for the   most   part   spent   locally   and   there   will   be   flow   on   effects to   businesses from stagnant wages growth.   Ultimately   businesses will   see this   in   lower         sales,   despite   having   interests   in   also   keeping cost structures   low   by   pushing for flexible wages      and flexible work   patterns from their workers. There   is a government   policy   trade   off   that   must   be   managed well to avoid   low wages growth feeding   into   low   consumption growth,   thus dragging down economic growth. The signs are   there,   in   the   current   dilemma   that   the   RBA   is attempting to grapple with. Why with a   rise   in   employment   are   Consumption   and   GDP   growth   not   meeting   predicted growth   rates?
Questions:
8.1    What does an economy’s   potential   output   level   represent   and   how   is this   related   to   the   main types of   unemployment?
8.2       What do current   unemployment, GDP   and   inflation   statistics   suggest   about   what   stage   of   the   business cycle the Australian economy   is currently   in?
8.3    Using   the   AD/AS    model,   and   assuming   the   economy   starts   at   full   employment,   explain   in   words the effect of   reduced consumption   by   households.
8.4    Using the AD/AS   model,   and   assuming   the   economy   starts   below   full   employment,   explain   in   words the   effect   of   a   decrease   in the   rate   of   consumption   and the   long   run   self-correction   of   the economy.
